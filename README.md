# city-guesser
city-guesser is game that helps you get better at [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com) by helping you recognize patterns in the names of cities. It is currently set up to work for all the European countries on GeoGuessr, but it can easily be expanded to allow for an infinite amount of countries just by tweaking a few variables and adding to the CSV file.

The current dataset `countries.csv` contains all 37 European countries on GeoGuessr, with the twenty most populated cities in each country. It is imported as a 2D array into the program. Feel free to tweak it to make it work for other areas of the world, or use the code for something different entirely.
